# facial_recognition
A collection of facial recognition scripts utilizing the OpenCV library and common feature detection algorithms/techniques.

The 'facial_recognition.py' script is a work in progress that takes 20 dataSet pictures of your face, trains a classifier, queries an internal SQLite3 db, and "recognizes" you for the next time.
